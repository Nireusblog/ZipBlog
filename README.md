# Technical Design Document: Blog Application

## Overview
The Blog Application is a web application designed to allow users to create and view blog posts. The application consists of a front-end user interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a back-end server built using Java and the Spring Boot framework. The server-side application stores data in a MySQL database.

## Architecture
The Blog Application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. The Model layer consists of a MySQL database, which stores blog post data. The View layer is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is responsible for rendering the user interface. The Controller layer is implemented using the Spring Boot framework, and provides the application's business logic and RESTful API endpoints.

## Database Schema
The MySQL database consists of two tables: `blog_post` and `blog_tag`. The `blog_post` table stores information about each blog post, including the post's ID, title, content, author, and creation date. The `blog_tag` table stores information about each blog tag, including the tag's ID and name. A many-to-many relationship is maintained between the `blog_post` and `blog_tag` tables using a junction table named `blog_post_tag`.

## API Endpoints
The following RESTful API endpoints are provided by the Controller layer:

- `GET /posts`: Returns a list of all blog posts.
- `GET /posts/{id}`: Returns details of a specific blog post.
- `GET /tags`: Returns a list of all blog tags.
- `GET /tags/{id}/posts`: Returns a list of all blog posts with a specific tag.
- `POST /posts`: Creates a new blog post.
- `PUT /posts/{id}`: Updates details of a specific blog post.
- `DELETE /posts/{id}`: Deletes a specific blog post.

## Front-End Implementation
The front-end user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The UI includes a navigation bar, which allows users to filter blog posts by tag, a section for displaying blog post previews, and a section for displaying individual blog posts. Users can create new blog posts using a form that includes fields for entering a post's title, content, and tags. Users can also upload images to include in their blog posts.

## Conclusion
The Blog Application provides users with a platform for creating and viewing blog posts. The application is built using a modern, scalable architecture and provides a clean, easy-to-use user interface. The application's RESTful API endpoints allow for easy integration with third-party tools and services.
